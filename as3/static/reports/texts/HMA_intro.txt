Each course is designed upon a certain skill level and is gradually adapted to create new skills based on the individual's experience, from the very basic to the most advanced, measuring each step scientifically.<br/>

The ability to respond effectively to pressure and stress is critical. How each student responds will vary; some people thrive on it and perform better when under pressure, others may panic or become ineffective. Driving under pressure involves dealing with constraints outside of the driver's control while operating the motor vehicle at above 80% of its physical capability through an ever-changing environment; this requires creating and maintaining a set of perishable skills that can only be obtained through exposure and repetition.<br/>
