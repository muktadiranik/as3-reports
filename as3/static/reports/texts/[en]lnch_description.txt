Based on the research published by the Society of Automotive Engineers, in this exercise, students are pushed to the limits of cognitive reaction times through an electronically operated signal system that allows them little room for error. The Barricade requires situational awareness and decision-making while using all the skills acquired in the Slalom, adding a psychological factor as the speed through the exercise is slightly increased.<br/>

Just as the Slalom, this exercise requires skill as it is graded at 80% of the car's lateral acceleration capability and requires the same speed consistency as stated above.
