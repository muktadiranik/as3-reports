<para>Regardless of if the students attended a one-day or two-day course, we cannot focus solely on creating skills. We choose instead to develop a mindset that will allow the student to make decisions based on an accurate memory of a situation they have experienced before that will enable them to understand what is happening at all times so decisions based on a deep understanding of the consequences of their inputs.<br/>
<br/>
In all our courses, a score above 80% on the final run is to be expected, but there is a very noticeable difference between a one-day and a two-day course in the achievement of the students; once the skills are set, all they need to do is maintain them through deliberate practice.<br/>
<br/>
The average security driver's performance should be between 70-80%.<br/>
<br/>
Anything below 50% should be analyzed to find a more profound problem, although some students present low scores simply because they lost their way on the exercise, or they had too many penalties; most common problems are:<br/>
<br/>
<seqreset id="spam"/><seq id="spam"/>. Lack of skills/practice<br/>
<seq id="spam"/>. Inadequate response to stress<br/>
<br/>
These can be improved with extended training and stress inoculation.<br/>
<br/>
Other problems that we have encountered and that could present a problem for a security driver are:<br/>
<seqreset id="spam"/><seq id="spam"/>. Attention deficits<br/>
<seq id="spam"/>. Dyslexia<br/>
<br/>
A professional should examine these conditions; our driving evaluation cannot and should not be considered a diagnosis for any condition or disability.
