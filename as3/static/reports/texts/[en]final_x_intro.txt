<font size="14"><b>MULTI-DISCIPLINARY EXERCISE -</b></font><br/> 9 Obstacles, fixed/rolling ambush.<br/>
<br/>
This is the final exercise of the course; it is a multidisciplinary routine consisting of all the basic disciplines practiced during the training; it requires each student to complete it with a grade of 80% or more, and everyone has two opportunities to go through it with increasing levels of stress based on their experience and performance. (Additional opportunities are granted to anyone that struggles to reach the minimum).<br/>
<br/>
This exercise measures:<br/><br/>
<b>SPEED:</b> The grading is done by comparing the student's time to a professional instructor's fastest lap around the course. This grades the student's capacity to make decisions and control the vehicle at speeds where things can get out of control fast.<br/><br/>
<b>CONTROL:</b> The computers measure each student's performance during reverse, slalom, and barricade evasion, providing a clear KPI of the student's ability under stress in close-to-reality situations.
