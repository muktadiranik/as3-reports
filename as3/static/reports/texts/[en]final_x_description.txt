<font size="7" fontname="MontserratLight" color="grey"><b>STRESS LEVELS –</b> This involves external distractors and highlights the driver’s strengths and weaknesses, some people perform better under stress, but most have to work harder to get the same results.<br/>
<b>FINAL TIME –</b> This is the time (including penalties) in which the student completed the test.<br/>
<b>% REVERSE –</b> This shows the percentage of their total time spent through the reverse slalom. An acceptable score is less than 20% of the Overall All Performance. Anything above shows that the student must work in his reversing skills as it is essential for security.<br/>
<b>SLALOM & BARRICADE % -</b> 80% of the vehicle’s capability is desirable; not a requisite to pass the course. Only advanced drivers achieve that proficiency level and even less do so while under pressure. <font color="black" backColor="red"><b>A 0 value means that the student skipped the exercise, or he had too many penalties.</b></font><br/>
<b>PENALTIES –</b> Precision is always prefered over speed, a slower time with no penalties is preferred over a fast time with many penalties.<br/>
<b>FINAL RESULT –</b> Only students who achieve 80% in the final test approve the course; every student gets two chances, with added opportunities until the minimum grade is achieved; more runs describe a longer journey to build a skill.</font>
